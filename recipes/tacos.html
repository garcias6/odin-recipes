    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a recipe for birria tacos. These tacos are made from shredded beef
      with special seasonings, and corn tortillas. You can use tortillas you've
      made from scratch if you're feeling ambitious, or you can buy corn
      tortillas at your local store.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tacos can also be made with shredded goat meat, but we will not be
      discussing that option here.
